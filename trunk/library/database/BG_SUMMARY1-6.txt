CHAPTER 5 KARMA YOGA - ACTION IN KRISHNA CONCIOUSNESS

SUMMARY: work in devotional service is better than dry mental speculation.

- Arjuna again asks whether renouncing work is superior to working with detachment. Krsna replies that both are equal, as they have the same goal. But Krsna recommends working with detachment (niskama karma) because it is easier to perform.

- One performing niskama karma neither identifies with his body or the activities that his body performs. He, through his detached actions, is thus free from the reactions from his activities.

- The living being (doer 1) who knows that all bodily activities are automatically carried out by the three modes of material nature (doer 2) after those activities are sanctioned by the Supersoul (doer 3) attains enlightenment through that knowledge.

- One who is in knowledge, devotionally fixes his consciousness on the Supersoul and remains materially equipoise, attains liberation.

- One can also achieve the same liberation through astanga yoga.

- A person in full consciousness of Krsna attains liberation from the pangs of material miseries and becomes peaceful. 

CONNECTION BETWEEN 5 and 6

- In 5th chapter, Krsna explained how to get to the platform of liberation through niskama karma(working with detachment). One who controls his mind and senses knowing that he is aloof from all material activities and thus performs his duty without attachment, surrendering the results unto the Supreme Lord, is unaffected by sinful action and attains liberation from material miseries.

- In the 6th chapter krsna explains that the same goal of liberation can be acheived through a different 
process, the process of astanga yoga.
